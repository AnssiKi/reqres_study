-The user can log in, and the server's response is displayed (works only with a predefined user).
-The number of user pages is fetched from the server, and page buttons are created accordingly.
-Clicking a page button fetches the user data for that specific page, and all fields are displayed.
-Each user is provided with update and delete buttons.
-User information can be updated via the update button, and the server's response is displayed.
-Users can be deleted via the delete button; the deletion is sent to the server, and the user is removed from the display.
-A new user can be created, and the server's response is displayed.
-The code is organized into proper folder and file structures, using code modules.
-All operations that might take time (e.g., server communication) are implemented using promises. Prefer async/await and handle errors with try/catch.
